# **StoryWeave**

**Project Description:**
What Is StoryWeave?
StoryWeave is an interactive platform where users team up to write stories together in real-time. Everyone adds a sentence or paragraph, and then—bam!—an AI jumps in with wild, unexpected plot twists based on what’s already been written. Picture this: one minute you’re crafting a sweet romance, and the next, the AI declares, “Suddenly, the wedding cake explodes, revealing a secret alien invasion!” It’s chaotic, hilarious, and totally unique every time.
